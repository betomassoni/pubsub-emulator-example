# Kotlin API with Google Cloud Pub/Sub Emulator

This Kotlin REST API provides a practical implementation of the Google Cloud Pub/Sub emulator, allowing developers to send and receive messages locally and efficiently. Using an emulator facilitates development by simulating the behavior of Pub/Sub without the costs associated with using the cloud service. With this API send messages and receive notifications in a safe and controlled environment. This is particularly useful for integration testing and agile development, where speed and cost-effectiveness are essential. The project structure is based on Spring Boot, providing a familiar and robust experience for developers working with microservices and event-driven applications.

## Prerequisites
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: to run the Google Cloud Pub/Sub emulator.
- **Java 17 or higher**: required to run the Kotlin application.
- **Maven**: for managing dependencies and building the project.
